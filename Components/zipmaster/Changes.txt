   - some new resource strings
   Changes in 1.70:
   - Added property DirEntry[] (returns ZipDirEntry)
   - added defines to start of ZipMstr.pas to disable compiling support for DiskSpan & SFX
   - hidden (from Interface) many structure definitions - moved to Implementation or "ZipStructs.pas"
   - removed this file from the Interface section

   Changes in 1.60RP2:
   - Allow creating a new Zipfile with comment
   Changes in 1.60RP1:
   -Added bug fixes by Jim Turner
   -  Renaming a file in archive will trash central if has a comment at end
   -  Adding an empty comment may have no effect.
   Changes in 1.60RP
   -Fixed: unzip to wrong directory
   -Fixed: won't look for files in current directory if RootDir is empty
   Changes in 1.60o:
   -Added Encrypted boolean to ZipDirEntry record. (part of ZipContents)
	(Also added info to the help text regarding the value of 'Flag'
   -Writing of zipfile comments is now possible.
	(ZipDll changed also, now v1.60)
   -Renaming of one or more zip entries in a zip archive.
	(also with the possibility to change the datetime field)
	(progress events are supported)
   -Changed ConvertSFX to support the new MPV header.
	(The old ZipSFX.bin is no longer supported!!!)
   -Changed ConvertZIP to support the new MPV header.
	(old header can still be read)
   -New SFX option: SFXNoSuccessMsg
   -New SFX property: SFXMessage
   -New SFX property: SFXIcon
   -SFXCaption, SFXCommandLine, SFXDefaultDir and all other options are
	read back when converting from sfx to zip.
   -Changed Demo1 SfxUnit.
   -Added a rename unit to Demo1.
   -The Zip Dll is now reentrant, multiple threads can use it at the same time.
   -New property: AddStoreSuffixes Files with one of these extensions will be stored
	in the zip archive others will be deflated.
	default: assGIF+assPNG+assZ+assZIP+assZOO+assARC+assLZH+assARJ+assTAZ+assTGZ+assLHA
   -New AddOptions: AddArchiveOnly and AddResetArchive
   -Added: New event: OnSetNewName. While adding, the path/name can be changed.
   -Added: ExtractFileToStream function, Extract to a Memory stream without making an intermediate file.
	( Now position in the stream is reset.)
   -Auto SFX Create via Add went wrong when SFXConvert returned an error.
   -ZipDll.dll Add with Update did not work on an empty zip archive.
   -Fixed a bug in ConvertSFX while working with sfxblksize.
   -Changed the writing of the zip archive comment, now also without using the zip dll.
   -Added a new Event OnNewName this will be called when reading the Zip's directory
	and gives you the opportunity to fill for example a ListView. In previous versions
	you had to wait for the OnDirUpdate event, which is still supported.
   -Added new property PasswordReqCount, used to set the number of times a password will be
	requested through the OnPasswordError event.
   -Added a new Event OnPasswordError, this will be called when the given Password is wrong or
	not given at all.
	The UnZip dll itself will not ask for a password anymore when the components version
	number >= 1.6!!!
   -Added a new public method GetPassword which replaces the InputBox function used earlier.
	Uses now language dependent Resource text as output and while typing the password, a '*'
	will be shown.
   -Checked for and fixed a few memory leaks in the dll's and component.
   -Added the new event OnCRC32Error. On a CRC error it is now possible to skip the extraction of
	that file
   -Added the new property FSpecArgsExcl, used to specify file arguments which should be excluded
	(i.e. not zipped) during a zip operation. (like *.tmp, *.bak)
   -Added the new event OnExtractOverwrite, is complementary to the Extract Option ExtrOverwrite.
   -Added the new event OnExtractSkipped, called when a file is skipped during extraction with the
	reason why it is skipped.
   -Added property UseDirOnlyEntries bool, Do not include Directory only entries from the zip contents
  list. (See also AddOption AddSeparateDirs ) Default false;
   -Made it D2 comaptible.
   -Made it D3 compatible. Thanks to Dejan Maksimovic.
   -Added the new function CopyZippedFiles( DestZipMaster: TZipMaster; DeleteFromSource: boolean; OverwriteDest: OvrOpts ): Integer;
	(Used to copy zipped contents from one zip file to another without extracting and re-zipping.)
   -Added a new event OnCopyZipOverwrite used in combination with the new function CopyZippedFiles.
   -Added a new member 'ExtraData' to the ZipDirEntry record (needed for the function CopyZippedFiles.)
   -EraseFile() now prepends the full path from the current drive/dir if filename did not have one.
	(FOF_ALLOWUNDO does not seem to work when there is no full path!?)
   -Added to version 1.60K to support recursion and encryption on a FFileSpec basis.
	Regardless of what AddRecurseDirs is set to, a '>' will force recursion, and a '|' will stop recursion.
	(RCV + Bob Dolan), newest ZipDll needed too.
   -Also it is possible the specify a password after the FFileSpec, separated by a '<'
	If there is no other text after the '<' then, an existing password, is temporarily canceled.

	parameters: ( System::TObject *Sender, int DiskSeqNo, int DiskTotal, AnsiString Drive, bool &Cancel )
	(Requested by João Lira)
   -Added new event OnStatusDisk, used while diskspanning if assigned.
	enum ZipDiskStatusEnum		{ zdsEmpty, zdsHasFiles, zdsPreviousDisk, zdsSameFileName, zdsNotEnoughSpace };
	typedef Set<ZipDiskStatusEnum, zdsEmpty, zdsNotEnoughSpace> TZipDiskStatus;
	enum TZipDiskAction			{ zdaOk, zdaErase, zdaReject, zdaCancel };
	parameters: ( System::TObject *Sender, int PreviousDisk, AnsiString PreviousFile, TZipDiskStatus Status, TZipDiskAction &Action )
	(Requested by Tim Borman)
   -Added new event OnFileComment, used to set file comments while adding files to an archive.
	parameters: ( System::TObject *Sender, String ForFile, String &FileComment, bool IsChanged )
   -Added the new method MakeTempFileName, to assist in the internal flow of ZipMaster, but it is public.
   -Added the new property RootDir.
   -Added the new AddOption AddVolume.
   -Fixed bug in SFX file DialogSel, function SelectDir, found by Lucjan Lukasik.
   -Fixed error: Fatal error in ZIPDLL.DLL ( now version 1.6010 )
   -Sortgrid extended with CTRL click to select single rows.
   -GetAddPassword() now returns an empty string in case the passwords did not match.
   -The Unzip Dll now support changing the filenames on extract (DLL v1.6016)
   -Added the new property DirOnlyCount.
   -in version 1.60M:
   -Added method void AddStreamToFile( String FileName, long FileFlags ); Dll version 1.6015
   -Added method TZipStream *AddStreamToStream( TZipStream *InStream ); Dll version 1.6015
   -Added method ExtractStreamToStream( TMemoryStream *InStream, unsigned long OutSize ); Dll version 1.6023
   -Removed the Exclamation-Mark necessity in the Filename for SFXAutorun when the name is Setup.exe
   -When using SFX and an .inf file this file is now executed within the extract directory.
   -A 'Cancel all' and 'Abort' button in the password dialog.
   -Implement Recycle to the recycle bin when moving files.
	(When adding files with AddOptions set to 'move'.)
   -Added RAR, ACE, CAB, GZ, GZIP and JAR to the AddStoreSuffix property.
   -Changed the handling of RootDir and ExtrBaseDir, SetCurrentDir is no longer used because this may
	cause problems when using threads.

   To change:
 -Translation of the new Resource Messages.
 -Implement Cancel property in DiskSpan

   And ideas for changing/adding in version 1.7:
	-Borland recommends to give every Type a name starting with T....
	 Change you current naming convention from AddOptsEnum to TAddOptsEnum
	 same for AddOpts and so on).
   -Warning/skipping a file when it is opened by an other application for writing while adding.
	new event OnAddInUse.
   -UNC support everywhere.
   -SFX diskspan reading.
   -SFX codepage support? Ansi compare functions? Portuguese change?
   -SFX extract path from registry or temp dir change into user defined if regkey is missing.
   -A new event for some errors/warnings in the zipdll like:
	name in zip file repeated: : INSTALL.TXT
	first full name: C:\TestMap1\TestMap2\INSTALL.TXT
	second full name: C:\TestMap1\INSTALL.TXT
	bad zip options specified
   -MinDate, MaxDate, MinSize, MaxSize filtering properties.
   -OCX build of zip
   -SortGrid helpfile

  Changes in v1.52n, v1.60n:
   -For spanned archives on the HDD it would display that there was an error reading the
	zip file on the third disk. This was because I have set the MaxArchiveSize to 2Mb
	exactly and I’m reading in 8Kb chunks. This would cause the final read on the 2nd disk
	to fall on the EOF marker making SizeR equal 0. WriteJoin would then cause the error.
   -The ZipFilename is now changed to the name of the last 'disk' in the set when using
	diskspanning and the disk is not a diskette.

  Changes in v1.60m:
   -In List() the read of the extra field was put at the wrong place.
   -in ReadSpan a Zip archive comment was not handled as it should have been. bug solved
	thanks to Tim Borman.
   -Replaced (wait/default)cursor setting with a dynamic version, so the application
	program won't notice it, idea Danail Traichev.
   -Moved DLL handles and function pointers variables to ZipBuilder private in stead
	of as global variables. This should avoid problems with automatic DLL loading and
	unloading when using threads.
   -OnExtractOverwrite event added a DirIndex parameter.
   -FileExists replaced by a local function to prevent problems with ZipMagic when
	you do NOT set the exception program option in ZipMagic. Should also be somewhat
	faster. There is still a problem with ZipMagic because FileAge is used in
	DiskSpanning and this can't be replaced by GetFileAttributesEx because W95 does
	not know of this function. (proposal: Patricio Moschcovich)
   -Added HowToMove to the ZipDll, when using the Add Move option Undoing is preserved
	just as in the component.

  Changes in v1.52m:
   -AppendSlash() did not check on a 0-length string which could cause an
	access violation in the RootDir property. Bug found thanks to Richard Hollerich.
   -in ReadSpan a Zip archive comment was not handled as it should have been. bug solved
	thanks to Tim Borman.
   -Moved DLL handles and function pointers variables to ZipMaster private in stead
	of global variables. This should avoid problems with automatic DLL loading and
	unloading when using threads.
   -Added HowToMove to the ZipDll, when using the Add Move option Undoing is preserved
	just as in the component.

  Changes in v1.52l:
   -The event OnSetNewName did not work due to a error in the callback data

  Changes in v1.52k:
   -Fixed a bug in the ZipDll that prevented the use of the Add option AddForceDOS.
   -Fixed a bug in the ZipDll that prevented the use of the Add option AddZipTime.
   -Fixed a bug in the SFX source code, re-compilation always resulted in the message
	Error reading Archive File. Found thanks to Patrick Gentemann.
   -Added a new Read Only property VersionInfo.
   -Fixed the message: 'Error reading ZipMaster1.AddStoresSuffixes: Property does not exist.'
	when opening some demo projects.
   -Moved the assignment of the FErrCode and FMessage one line up in the function ShowExceptionError
	This way the property ErrCode can be used inside the OnMessage event handling. (The parameter
	ErrCode in this event is sometimes 0 while ErrCode is not.)

  Changes in v1.52j:
   -Changed most StrPCopy functions to StrPLCopy because of a bug in BCB1, Delphi2 and
	Delphi3 in these environments max. 255 characters are copied, reported by Tim Borman.
   -Added a line to WriteSpan to correctly read and write an existing archive comment.
	Found by Tim Borman.

  Changes in v1.52i:
   -Bug fix in List, ReadSpan to read to correct data when a disk change was neccessary.
	This prevented to open and read a spanned archive which had it's header data split
	across multiple disk(files). Found thanks to Alexander Hofmann.
   -Moved FreeLibrary which wasn't always called in DiskFreeAndSize.
   -Added a SetErrorMode because it wasn't always reset in IsDiskPresent.
   -Changed the function DirExists a little in case the given dir was an empty string. [Range error]
	Found by Thomas.
   -Added some properties to the SortGrid VC and as result removed some code from the demos.
	Idea by Andrea Gnesutta.
   -A new constant UNZIPVERSION 160, now Zip and Unzip dll may have different version numbers.

  Bug Fix in v1.52h:
   -In the function CheckForDisk in a format specifier '/n...' was used in stead of #13#10.
	thanks to Greg Nixon.
   -In the function WriteSplit a statement was missing that incremented the disk to use.
	This was most likely to happen when zipping to a large spanned archive, but also smaller
	archives could suffer from this this problem.
	thanks to Jim Hoops, Alexander Hofmann.

  Bug Fix in v1.52g:
   -Small addition to IsRightDisk function to make it possible to open files with UNC prefix.
	(this should have been there in the e version but somehow it did not.)
   -Fixed a memory leak in CheckIfLastDisk thanks to Greg Lorriman.

  Version f Added Russian language support.

  Bug Fix and change in v1.52e:
   -Better support for harddisks > 2Gb and UNC names.
	(Replacement function for DiskFree and DiskSize functions this also
	 prevented opening files given with an UNC name.)

  Bug Fix in v1.52d:
   -Reading of spanned disks written by WinZip did not work.

  Bug Fixes in v1.52c:
   -The messages DS_NotaDrive and DS_DriveNoMount expects a string as
	parameter but did in fact get an Integer and as result you would get
	a message: UnKnown error in function ReadSpan() or WriteSpan()
	Now there is an new exception constructor for these messages.
	Found by Tim Borman
   -When there was no disk in the drive no question was asked to put
	one in, instead an exception was raised an the spanning was aborted.
	Found by Tim Borman
   -If the size of the disk is not yet known there was still a question
	to put disk X of Y in the drive. Now this is changed in just Disk X.
	Not really a bug but annoying, Found by Tim Borman
   -The copy stage of the diskspan process is now a little faster.
	Thanks to Tim Borman
   -The function DiskSize returns in D4 an Int64 instead of an Integer.
	found by Sebastian Hildebrandt
   -Fixed a bug in the zip dll while handling slashes, this sometimes
	lead to a Fatal Error in ZipDLL.DLL: abort exception.
	Thanks to Sebastian Hildebrandt and Matthew Kent.

   Bug Fix in v1.52b:
   -While using DiskSpan in encrypted mode an error 'A Local Header
	Signature is wrong' or 'A Central Header Signature is wrong' was given.
	Found by Sam Chan.

   Bug Fixes in v1.52a:
   -Changed the search direction for the EOC record.
	(If there was a zip file stored in a ziparchive within the last 64K
	 the wrong archive directory was shown.)
   -Diskspanning with formatting with ConfirmErase = True did not work.
